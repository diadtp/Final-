Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS 2009) dataset is used to predict the Electricity used in
space conditioning i.e heating, cooling and water heating. The prediction for Electricity usage is done for
the state of Florida. The RECS data contains 948 observations for the state of Florida. Now,performing
some elementary analysis, we find that out of 113.6 million households in United States, 6.15 percent of
the households are in Florida state.
Now, to predict Electricity usage for space conditioning in FL, some important predictors are selected
out of the 940 variables present in the RECS dataset. The EIA RECS dataset is collected through detailed
surveys of the households in US. The algorithms used to estimated electricity usage for space conditioning
are a function of buildingâ€™s average thermal conductance, heating and cooling degree days and also take
into account the number of water heater tanks in a household and the type of roof material used.
